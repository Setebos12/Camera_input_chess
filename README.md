Documentation for the "ChessCam" Program

Introduction

"ChessCam" is an application that allows users to play chess using a camera. The program enables the reception of chess moves via the camera, facilitating interactive gameplay on a physical chessboard.

Features

    Reception of Chess Moves: The program allows users to make chess moves on a physical chessboard, which are then recorded using a camera.

    Recognition of Chess Pieces: The application utilizes image recognition models to determine which chess piece has been moved on the chessboard.

    Identification of Target Square: Upon detecting a chess piece, the program identifies the target square to which the piece is to be moved.

    User Interaction: The program communicates with the user, presenting recognition results and suggesting corrections in case of erroneous moves.

Requirements

Hardware Requirements:

    Computer with a webcam.
    Physical chessboard.

Software Requirements:

    Access to appropriate libraries and frameworks for image processing and machine learning.
    Installed models for recognizing chessboard images, chess pieces, and chess squares.

Implementation

The ChessCam program has been implemented in Python using popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It utilizes pretrained models for recognizing chessboard images, chess pieces, and chess squares.

Example Usage

    Launch the ChessCam program on your computer.
    Place the physical chessboard in front of the camera.
    Make a chess move by moving a piece on the chessboard.
    The program will automatically register your move and display it on the screen.
    Continue the game by making subsequent moves.
